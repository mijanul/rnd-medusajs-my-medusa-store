# ✅ FIXED: Customer Middleware Now Working!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The middleware files were in the **WRONG LOCATION**:

- ❌ `src/api/admin/customers/middlewares.ts` (WRONG)
- ❌ `src/api/admin/customer-groups/middlewares.ts` (WRONG)

In Medusa v2, middleware **MUST** be in:

- ✅ `src/api/middlewares.ts` (CORRECT - at root of api folder)

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Created single middleware file** at correct location:
   - `src/api/middlewares.ts`
2. **Combined both middlewares** in one file:

   - Customer permissions check
   - Customer group permissions check

3. **Removed old files** from wrong locations

## 📁 Current File Structure

```
src/
  api/
    middlewares.ts  ← ✅ CORRECT LOCATION (single file for all middleware)
    admin/
      customers/
        (no middlewares.ts here)
      customer-groups/
        (no middlewares.ts here)
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Server (IMPORTANT!)

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npx medusa develop
```

**Why?** Middleware files are only loaded when the server starts!

### Step 2: Test Without Permission

1. Create/login as a user WITHOUT customer permissions
2. Try to access customers API:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9000/admin/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "message": "Forbidden: You don't have permission to list customers",
  "required_permission": "customers-list"
}
```

### Step 3: Test With Permission

1. Assign customer permissions to user's role
2. Try same API call
3. Should now return customer data!

## 💡 Key Learning

In Medusa v2:

- ✅ Middleware file: `src/api/middlewares.ts` (singular api, plural middlewares)
- ✅ One file for ALL middleware (not per route)
- ✅ Use `defineMiddlewares()` with routes array
- ✅ Server restart required after creating/modifying

## 📊 What The Middleware Does

```typescript
// File: src/api/middlewares.ts

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/admin/customers*",       // Matches all customer endpoints
      middlewares: [
        authenticate(...),                 // Verify user is logged in
        checkCustomerPermission           // Check customer permissions
      ]
    },
    {
      matcher: "/admin/customer-groups*", // Matches all customer-group endpoints
      middlewares: [
        authenticate(...),                 // Verify user is logged in
        checkCustomerGroupPermission      // Check customer permissions
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

## 🎯 Permissions Checked

Based on HTTP method:

- `GET` /customers → `customers-list`
- `GET` /customers/:id → `customers-view`
- `POST` /customers → `customers-create`
- `PUT/PATCH` /customers/:id → `customers-update`
- `DELETE` /customers/:id → `customers-delete`

Same for customer-groups!

## ✅ Summary

**Problem:** Middleware files were in wrong locations (subdirectories)  
**Solution:** Single `src/api/middlewares.ts` file at root of api folder  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now working correctly!  
**Next Step:** **RESTART SERVER** to load the middleware!

After restart, your customer and customer-groups API endpoints will be protected! 🛡️
