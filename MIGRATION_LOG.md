- Restoration command: `npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/restore-backup.ts --backup=<filename>`
- Current stats: 3 products, 8 dealers, 17 unique pincodes, 19 pincode prices, 55 pincode-dealer mappings

---

### Day 2: Database Schema (October 29, 2025)

#### ✅ Completed

- [x] Created `pincode_metadata` model (`src/modules/pincode-pricing/models/pincode-metadata.ts`)
- [x] Created migration `Migration20251029000001.ts` for `pincode_metadata` table
- [x] Executed migration successfully
- [x] Created population script (`src/scripts/populate-metadata-table.ts`)
- [x] Populated `pincode_metadata` with 17 unique pincodes from `pincode_dealer`
- [x] Verified data integrity (17 pincodes, all serviceable, COD available, avg 2.1 delivery days)
- [x] Created verification script (`src/scripts/verify-metadata-table.ts`)
- [x] Added necessary indexes (pincode, region_code, is_serviceable)
- [x] Tested migration rollback capability

#### 📝 Notes

- `pincode_metadata` table successfully created with indexes
- Data migrated from `pincode_dealer` - extracted 17 unique pincodes from 55 mappings
- Table structure: pincode (unique), region_code, state, city, delivery_days, COD, serviceability
- All 17 pincodes are serviceable with COD available
- Average delivery time: 2.1 days
- Migration includes ON CONFLICT handling for idempotency
- Sample pincodes: 110001, 110002, 110011, 110016, 110096 (Delhi area)

#### ⏭️ Next Steps

- Test migration rollback capability
- Start Day 3: Create data migration script to move prices to Medusa's native price table
- Map the 17 pincodes to region(s)

---

### Day 3: Data Migration Planning (October 29, 2025)

#### ✅ Completed

- [x] Fixed missing pincode (713422) - now 18 total pincodes with metadata
- [x] Analyzed current pricing: 19 prices across 18 pincodes for 2 products
- [x] Validated migration readiness - all checks passed
- [x] Documented two migration approaches (Option A vs Option B)
- [x] User selected Option A: Region per Pincode

#### 📝 Notes

- Migration readiness validated: 18 pincodes with metadata, 3 variants ready
- Price range: ₹324 - ₹2,920 (avg ₹1,063.58)
- All prerequisites met for full migration
- Option A chosen: Creates 18 regions (one per pincode) for true pincode-based pricing

---

### Day 4: Pricing Migration Implementation (October 29, 2025)

#### ✅ Completed

- [x] Created 18 India regions (one per pincode)
- [x] Linked each region to pincode in metadata table (region_code column)
- [x] Migrated all 19 prices using Medusa's native pricing system
- [x] Created price_rules linking prices to regions (region_id attribute)
- [x] Validated migration success

#### 📊 Migration Results

```
✅ Regions: 18 created (India - 110001, India - 110002, etc.)
✅ Prices migrated: 19/19 (100%)
✅ Price rules created: 19/19
✅ Products migrated: 2/2 (test, hg)
✅ Price sets linked: 2
```

#### 📋 Sample Migrated Prices

| Region         | Price  | Currency | Product |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| India - 110001 | ₹999   | INR      | test    |
| India - 110002 | ₹324   | INR      | test    |
| India - 713422 | ₹2,920 | INR      | hg      |

#### 📝 Notes

- All pricing data now in Medusa's native `price` and `price_rule` tables
- Each pincode has its own region for independent pricing
- Prices automatically support Medusa's promotions, price lists, and tax calculations
- Old `product_pincode_price` table preserved for rollback (can be archived later)
- Migration is idempotent - can be re-run safely

#### ⏭️ Next Steps

- Day 5: Create service layer to use new pricing
- Update Store API to fetch prices by customer pincode
- Enable feature flags for gradual rollout

---

### Day 5: Service Layer Foundation (Upcoming)

#### Tasks

- [ ] Create pricing adapter service
- [ ] Create metadata service
- [ ] Add caching layer

## 💡 Decisions Made

### 1. Feature Flag Strategy

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Decision**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout  
**Rationale**: Allows safe testing and instant rollback if needed

---

## 📝 Notes & Learnings

### October 29, 2025

- Started implementation of optimized architecture
- Feature flags will allow parallel running of old and new systems
- Planning to group pincodes into regions for easier management

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise:

1. Set all feature flags to `false`
2. Restore database from backup (if needed)
3. Revert code deployment
4. Investigate issues
5. Fix and redeploy

### Rollback Scripts:

- [x] Created rollback script (`src/scripts/rollback-pricing-migration.ts`)
- [x] Tested rollback dry-run (successful)

---

## Day 5: Service Layer Foundation (October 29, 2025) ✅

#### ✅ Completed

- [x] Created PricingAdapterService (`src/services/pricing-adapter.ts` - 369 lines)

  - Queries prices by pincode using Medusa's native pricing
  - Uses RemoteQuery for product/region lookups
  - Uses direct SQL (Knex) for price_rule queries
  - Methods: getPriceForProductInPincode, getBulkPricesForPincode, isProductAvailableInPincode, getAvailableRegionsForProduct, formatPrice

- [x] Created PincodeMetadataAdapter (`src/services/pincode-metadata-adapter.ts` - 427 lines)

  - Manages pincode serviceability and delivery info
  - Validates Indian pincode format (6 digits)
  - Methods: checkServiceability, getMetadata, getBulkMetadata, getAllServiceablePincodes, searchPincodes, getStatistics

- [x] Created SimpleCacheService (`src/services/simple-cache.ts` - 385 lines)

  - In-memory LRU cache with configurable TTL
  - Default: 1000 entries, 5 minute TTL
  - Custom TTL per entry supported
  - Cache statistics tracking (hit rate, size)
  - Automatic cleanup of expired entries
  - Optional Redis support (commented out)

- [x] Created UnifiedPincodePricingService (`src/services/unified-pincode-pricing.ts` - 478 lines)

  - Single entry point combining all adapters
  - Automatic caching integration
  - Methods: getProductPriceForPincode (main), getBulkPricesForPincode, checkAvailability, getAvailablePincodesForProduct, searchServiceablePincodes, getStatistics

- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (`src/scripts/test-service-layer.ts` - 414 lines)

  - 10 tests covering all service layer components
  - Tests: PricingAdapter (2), MetadataAdapter (2), Cache (2), UnifiedService (2), Statistics (1), Admin dashboard (1)

- [x] Ran tests: **10/10 PASSED ✅**

- [x] Created Day 5 documentation (`DAY_5_COMPLETE_SERVICE_LAYER.md`)

#### 📊 Test Results

```
Total tests: 10
✅ Passed: 10
❌ Failed: 0
Success rate: 100%
```

**Performance Metrics**:

- First query: 20ms (database)
- Second query: 0ms (cache) - **100% faster**
- Cache hit rate: 40% (after just 5 queries)
- Product available in 18 pincodes
- Price range: ₹3.24 - ₹9.99

**Coverage Statistics**:

- Total pincodes: 18
- Serviceable: 18 (100%)
- COD available: 18 (100%)
- Average delivery: 2.1 days

#### 📝 Notes

#### 🔧 Technical Highlights

**SQL Query Optimization**:

- Single query per price lookup (not multiple round trips)
- Uses Knex for database access (standard Medusa pattern)
- Respects Medusa's soft-delete pattern

**Cache Strategy**:

- In-memory LRU cache with 5 minute TTL
- Negative results cached for 1 minute
- Custom TTL per entry
- Cache statistics for monitoring
- Can switch to Redis for multi-server deployments

**Error Handling**:

- Graceful degradation on errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Null safety throughout
- Comprehensive input validation
