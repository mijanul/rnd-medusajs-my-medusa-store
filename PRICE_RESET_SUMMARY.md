## üîß Scripts Created

### 1. `src/scripts/reset-prices.ts`

Main script that:

- Deletes all existing prices (soft delete)
- Fetches all products from database
- Fetches all pincodes from `pincode_dealer` table
- Generates random prices for each product-pincode combination
- Base price is random between ‚Çπ499 - ‚Çπ9,999
- Each pincode gets ¬±10% variance from base price
- Assigns prices to random dealers per pincode
- Batch inserts prices (100 at a time)

**Usage:**

```bash
yarn medusa exec ./src/scripts/reset-prices.ts
```

### 2. `src/scripts/verify-prices.ts`

Verification script that:

- Lists first 20 prices with dealer information
- Shows statistics (total, min, max, average)

**Usage:**

```bash
yarn medusa exec ./src/scripts/verify-prices.ts
```

### 3. `src/scripts/show-prices-by-product.ts`

Detailed view script that:

- Shows all prices organized by product
- Displays price range and average per product
- Lists all pincode-price-dealer combinations

**Usage:**

```bash
yarn medusa exec ./src/scripts/show-prices-by-product.ts
```

## üíæ Database Structure

### Table: `product_pincode_price`

```
- id: unique identifier
- product_id: links to product.id
- sku: product handle (for CSV mapping)
- pincode: 6-digit Indian pincode
- dealer_id: links to dealer.id
- price: amount in paise (INR √ó 100)
- is_active: boolean flag
- created_at, updated_at, deleted_at: timestamps
```

### Price Storage

- Prices are stored in **paise** (smallest unit of INR)
- Example: ‚Çπ7,050 is stored as 705000 paise
- Always divide by 100 to display in rupees

---

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Random Base Price Generation**

   - Each product gets a random base price between ‚Çπ499 and ‚Çπ9,999
   - This ensures variety in product pricing

2. **Pincode Variance**

   - Each pincode gets ¬±10% variance from the base price
   - Simulates regional price differences
   - Example: Base ‚Çπ1,000 ‚Üí Pincode prices between ‚Çπ900 - ‚Çπ1,100

3. **Dealer Assignment**

   - Each pincode has multiple dealers
   - Script randomly picks one dealer per pincode
   - Realistic distribution across dealers

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Prices are inserted in batches of 100
   - Improves performance for large datasets
   - Provides progress updates during insertion
