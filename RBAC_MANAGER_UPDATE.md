# RBAC Manager Navigation Update

## Summary of Changes

Successfully migrated the Role Management and Permissions UI from separate menu items into a unified "RBAC Manager" extension with nested navigation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New RBAC Manager Structure

```
/admin/routes/rbac-manager/
├── page.tsx                              # Landing page with two cards
├── role-management/
│   ├── page.tsx                         # List all roles
│   ├── create/page.tsx                  # Create new role
│   └── [id]/page.tsx                    # Edit role
└── resource-management/
    ├── page.tsx                         # List all resourceManagement/permissions
    ├── create/page.tsx                  # Create new resource
    └── [resource]/page.tsx              # Edit resource
```

### 2. Removed Old Routes

- ✅ Deleted `/admin/routes/roles/` folder
- ✅ Deleted `/admin/routes/permissions/` folder

### 3. Updated Navigation Paths

All internal navigation has been updated from:

- `/roles` → `/rbac-manager/role-management`
- `/roles/create` → `/rbac-manager/role-management/create`
- `/roles/{id}` → `/rbac-manager/role-management/{id}`
- `/permissions` → `/rbac-manager/resource-management`
- `/permissions/create` → `/rbac-manager/resource-management/create`
- `/permissions/{resource}` → `/rbac-manager/resource-management/{resource}`

### 4. Updated Widgets

- ✅ `role-management-dashboard.tsx` - Updated navigation links to new paths

## New User Experience

### In the Admin Panel

1. **RBAC Manager** (top-level menu item with shield icon)
   - Clicking opens a landing page
   - Two cards are displayed:
     - **Role Management** - Create and manage user roles
   - **Resource Management** - Define permission Resource Management

### Navigation Flow

```
Extensions Menu
└── RBAC Manager 🛡️
    ├── Role Management
    │   ├── List Roles
    │   ├── Create Role
    │   └── Edit Role
    └── Resource Management
        ├── List Resource Management
        ├── Create Resource
        └── Edit Resource
```

## Technical Notes

- All API endpoints remain unchanged (`/admin/roles/`, `/admin/permissions/`)
- Only UI routing paths were updated
- Widget links automatically navigate to the new paths
- All functionality preserved (CRUD operations, permissions assignment, etc.)
