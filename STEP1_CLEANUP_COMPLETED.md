## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Permission Seeding (40 Permissions Created)

All permissions for 8 modules with 5 actions each:

| Module         | Resource      | Permissions                        |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🛍️ Orders      | `orders`      | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 📦 Products    | `products`    | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 📊 Inventory   | `inventory`   | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 👥 Customers   | `customers`   | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 🎁 Promotions  | `promotions`  | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 💰 Price Lists | `price_lists` | create, delete, list, view, update |
| ⚙️ Settings    | `settings`    | create, delete, list, view, update |
| 📄 Pages       | `pages`       | create, delete, list, view, update |

### 2. ✅ Test Permission Cleanup (8 Permissions Deleted)

Successfully removed all test permissions:

**Test Resource (3 permissions):**

- ❌ `test-list` (01K7PCCMTATKMEH4RT0MY1CGGQ)
- ❌ `test-create` (01K7PCCMTK2WP2X22Y5X13R3HA)
- ❌ `test-delete` (01K7PCCMTRZE5DVXDP1Y7QS2EW)

**Test2 Resource (5 permissions):**

- ❌ `test2-list` (01K7PE039T58DSSQZEG1M8PM1H)
- ❌ `test2-view` (01K7PE03AATG21QVRNN0T8T94X)
- ❌ `test2-create` (01K7PE03AC2SR41G80ZD0AW4RZ)
- ❌ `test2-edit` (01K7PE03AFRYYPYV8D74KR4K0S)
- ❌ `test2-delete` (01K7PE03AH400N8X83564C9B8K)

## Scripts Created

### 1. Core Scripts

| Script                  | Purpose               | Command                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `seed-roles.ts`         | Create permissions    | `npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/seed-roles.ts`         |
| `verify-permissions.ts` | Verify database state | `npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/verify-permissions.ts` |

### 2. Deletion Scripts

| Script                   | Purpose                | When to Use                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `cleanup-permissions.ts` | Auto-delete Test/Test2 | Quick cleanup, no config      |
| `delete-permissions.ts`  | Custom deletion        | Flexible deletion with config |

## How to Delete Permissions in the Future

### Option 1: Quick Cleanup (Edit Script)

Edit `cleanup-permissions.ts` and modify the test resources array:

```typescript
const testResources = ["Test", "Test2", "your_old_module"];
```

Then run:

```bash
npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/cleanup-permissions.ts
```

### Option 2: Flexible Deletion (Configure and Run)

Edit `delete-permissions.ts`:

```typescript
const DELETE_CONFIG = {
  // Delete all permissions for specific resources
  deleteByResource: ["old_module", "deprecated_feature"],

  // Delete specific permissions by name
  deleteByName: ["orders-some_old_action"],

  // Delete by specific IDs
  deleteById: ["perm_id_12345"],

  confirmDelete: true, // Set to false for dry run
};
```

Then run:

```bash
npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/delete-permissions.ts
```

### Option 3: SQL Direct (Quick & Simple)

```sql
-- Delete all permissions for a resource
DELETE FROM role_permission
WHERE permission_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM permission WHERE resource = 'resource_name'
);

DELETE FROM permission
WHERE resource = 'resource_name';

-- Delete specific permission by name
DELETE FROM role_permission
WHERE permission_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM permission WHERE name = 'permission-name'
);

DELETE FROM permission
WHERE name = 'permission-name';
```

npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/verify-permissions.ts
```

### Create New Permissions (Seeding)

```bash
npx medusa exec ./src/scripts/seed-roles.ts
```

## Next Steps

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Step 1: Permission seeding for all modules
- [x] Cleanup: Removed test permissions
- [x] Created deletion utilities for future use

### 🔜 Ready for Step 2

**Auto-Permission Creation for New Custom Models**

When you create a new custom model (like Pages), automatically generate permissions for it.

### 🔜 Ready for Step 3

**Permission-Based UI Restrictions**

- Hide sidebar items based on view permission
- Show "Restricted" UI for unauthorized access
- Works for both Medusa core and custom modules
